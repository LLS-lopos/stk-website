title: 'Making Tracks: Testing'
toc: true

After following the instructions in previous modules, you should now be ready to test your track. However, you will also want to retest later on as you add more to your track. You should also be advised that, if possible, seek the opinion of someone other than yourself about your track. They'll be less likely to be biased and can often give you better advice. Try posting your track on the forum, or have a friend try your track prototype.

## Exporting

Under Scene Properties, under Track Exporter, click "Export Track". In the same directory as your .blend file, you should find another directory called "tracks". Inside the "tracks" folder, copy the folder with the name of your track to the SuperTuxKart track addons directory:

* On Windows: %APPDATA%/supertuxkart/addons/tracks
* On Linux: ~/.local/share/supertuxkart/addons/tracks
* On macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/supertuxkart/addons/tracks

Also be sure to copy any textures you used that were not from the media repository.

Now, start SuperTuxKart and find your track under the "Add-Ons" section when you set up a race.

## Guidelines

As you drive your track, watch to make sure your track follows the guidelines listed at [Making Tracks: Notes\#gameplay](Making_Tracks:_Notes#gameplay)

## About Fixing Problems

To make your track more future-proof, edit the BÃ©zier curve you created in the previous module, delete your track and driveline, and then create new ones and reapply the array and curve modifiers. That way, you can easily remake your track later on without having to correct issues with driveability again.

## Conclusion

This article is short, but be sure to spend plenty of time testing your track. It should be fun to drive, because even pretty decorations and landscaping, which you'll learn about in future sections, won't make up for a boring track.
