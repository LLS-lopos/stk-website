Welcome to the track-making tutorial. If you're familiar with SuperTuxKart, you probably remember the old Track Maker's Guide. While most of the needed content was available in the old guide, certainly not all of it was (especially lighting) and it was difficult to follow and overall badly in need of repair.

This new guide is redesigned to be much more organized. Each section, or module, is clearly defined and sometimes usable by multiple tutorials, yet designed to fit in chronological order.

This page is a list of the modules in the Making Tracks tutorial. Note that not all are only for tracks: certain pages are also used in other guides.
