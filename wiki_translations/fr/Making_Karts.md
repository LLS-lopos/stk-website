Welcome to the kart-making tutorial. Kart-making is a good starting place for fairly experienced Blender users who don't want to commit the time required for a full track. Kart-making, however, does require you to be rather experienced with skeletal animation, so if you're very new to Blender [Making Library Nodes](Making_Library_Nodes) is probably a better place to start.
