Congratulations! You've (hopefully) completed your track. You may want to take screenshots in [Artist Debug Mode](Artist_Debug_Mode) or with a [cutscene](Cutscenes). You should have been communicating with the team while you made the track, but if not, present it to the team and the community on the forum or upload it to the add-on website.

If you have any problems, check out [Appendix A: Troubleshooting](Making_Tracks:_Appendix_A:_Troubleshooting) for help.

If you're interested, you may want to make your track more dynamic with [scripting](Scripting).
