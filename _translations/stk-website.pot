msgid "The next major release of SuperTuxKart, named SuperTuxKart Evolution is currently under development. Building upon the foundation laid by all those who made STK what it is today, <strong>SuperTuxKart Evolution will be the biggest release in STK's history in terms of new content</strong>: new tracks, new features, improved gameplay, enhanced graphics, and much more. A roadmap will be released in an upcoming update.

As part of our efforts towards SuperTuxKart Evolution, the SuperTuxKart team will also improve communication with the community, with more frequent updates on our plans and an upcoming forum for people to talk about the game. We also want to make it easier for new contributors to join us on our journey.

Unfortunately, we had to remove from the team a contributor who went rogue, and the supertuxkart.net domain is no longer under our control. <strong>Make sure to bookmark [our new website](https://supertuxkart-evolution.com/).</strong> You can also follow us [on Twitter](https://x.com/STK_Evolution) for updates about the project.  Additional information is available in our [special FAQ](STK_Evolution_FAQ). "
