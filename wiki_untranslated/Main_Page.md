<h2>SuperTuxKart Evolution</h2>

{%translate The next major release of SuperTuxKart, named SuperTuxKart Evolution is currently under development. Building upon the foundation laid by all those who made STK what it is today, <strong>SuperTuxKart Evolution will be the biggest release in STK's history in terms of new content</strong>: new tracks, new features, improved gameplay, enhanced graphics, and much more. A roadmap will be released in an upcoming update.

As part of our efforts towards SuperTuxKart Evolution, the SuperTuxKart team will also improve communication with the community, with more frequent updates on our plans. A [new forum](https://forum.supertuxkart.net/) has been opened for people to talk about the game and ask us questions. We also want to make it easier for new contributors to join us on our journey.

Additional information is available in our [STK Evolution FAQ](STK_Evolution_FAQ). %}
