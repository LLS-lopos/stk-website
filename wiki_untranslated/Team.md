Upon Hiker's retirement from the project in 2019, Alayan became co-leader of STK. After a period away from the game, he came back in 2023 to lead efforts towards a new major version.

{% include character_presentation name="Sven: Lead Artist" type="odd" description="I started to play STK in 2016 on a very old PC. Because of that I could only play the 0.8.1 release even though at that time 0.9.2 was the newest one.
But still at that time I started to learn blender to create my own tracks.
Iâ€™ve contributed some tracks to the add-ons and Black Forest was my first track that made it into the main game.
For the first release of SuperTuxKart Evolution there will be many new tracks created by me." icon="/assets/wiki/Sven_icon.png" %}
